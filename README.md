# Agentic EHR

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

**A ground-up reimagining of the Electronic Health Record.**

Legacy EHRs are template-driven data entry systems that burn out clinicians and fragment patient information across silos. Agentic EHR replaces that paradigm entirely. Instead of clicking through rigid forms, physicians speak naturally during patient encounters. The system listens, extracts structured clinical data from conversation, generates professional documentation, and surfaces evidence-based decision support — all in real time.

This is not an incremental upgrade to existing EHR workflows. It is a fundamentally different architecture: ambient voice input replaces manual data entry, AI-powered NLP replaces templates, and a multi-agent system learns each provider's documentation preferences over time. The goal is to return the physician's attention to the patient, not the screen.

## Features

- **Ambient voice capture** — real-time speech-to-text during clinical encounters
- **Automatic data extraction** — vitals, medications, problem lists, ROS, physical exam findings
- **SOAP note generation** — professional documentation from conversational input
- **Clinical Decision Support (CDS)** — evidence-based alerts, drug interaction checks, care gap detection
- **Multi-agent architecture** — 9 specialized AI agents (physician, MA, front desk, phone triage, CDS, quality, coding, orders, scribe) coordinated by an orchestrator via message bus
- **Provider learning** — adapts to individual physician documentation style and preferences
- **Prescription and lab ordering** — structured orders from natural language
- **Full audit trail** — HIPAA-compliant access logging on all PHI endpoints
- **PHI encryption** — AES-256-GCM field-level encryption with key rotation support
- **Role-based access control** — granular RBAC with scope validation
- **Offline-first** — works without internet using pattern-matching fallback (Claude API optional)
- **Docker-ready** — multi-stage build, non-root user, health checks, nginx reverse proxy

## Clinical Modules

The runtime is organized as nine explicit workflow modules with defined handoffs and safety boundaries.

| Module | Stage | Tier | Mission |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phone Triage | Access | 1 | Turn inbound calls into documented triage and routing decisions |
| Front Desk | Access / Pre-visit | 1 | Manage scheduling, patient contact, and pre-visit briefing assembly |
| Medical Assistant | Protocol execution | 2 | Execute refill, lab, and support workflows inside approved protocols |
| Physician | Clinical governance | 3 | Own protocols, escalation handling, and final clinical authority |
| Scribe | Encounter capture | 3 | Draft the SOAP note and structure encounter data |
| CDS | Encounter support | 2 | Surface alerts, care gaps, and evidence-based suggestions |
| Orders | Clinical execution | 3 | Assemble labs, imaging, referrals, and prescriptions for approval |
| Coding | Revenue / documentation | 2 | Generate E&M support, ICD-10 mapping, and completeness feedback |
| Quality | Oversight | 2 | Track care gaps, quality measures, and compliance readiness |

Patient-facing and patient-data-touching workflows stay inside authenticated, auditable boundaries. Tier 3 modules remain draft-only or recommendation-only until a physician approves them.

See `MODULE_CATALOG.md` for the canonical module map.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommended: 22 LTS)
- npm 9+

### Setup

```powershell
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mjrgman/AI-EHR.git
cd AI-EHR

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file (optional — runs in mock AI mode without it)
@"
PORT=3000
AI_MODE=mock
# AI_MODE=api
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
"@ | Set-Content -Path .env

# Start development server (frontend + backend)
npm run dev
```

If you skip `.env`, the app still runs in mock AI mode with default settings.

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | No | `3000` | Server port |
| `AI_MODE` | No | `mock` | `mock` for pattern-matching, `api` for Claude |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Only if `AI_MODE=api` | — | Claude API key |

| `PHI_PEPPER` | No | Auto-derived | Salt for searchable PHI hashing |
| `PROVIDER_NAME` | No | `Dr. Provider` | Default provider name for orders and notes |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | No | `./data/ehr.db` | SQLite database location |
| `NODE_ENV` | No | `development` | `production` enables static file serving |

## Security

- **PHI encryption** — AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 (100k iterations), per-record IVs, authentication tags
- **HIPAA middleware** — session tracking, PHI field detection, access logging, 15-minute timeout
- **RBAC** — role-based access control with scope validation
- **Helmet** — security headers on all responses
- **Rate limiting** — 100 req/min standard, 500 req/min system endpoints
- **Input sanitization** — all request bodies sanitized against injection
- **Parameterized queries** — no raw SQL concatenation
- **Audit logging** — all API calls logged with session, user, and timestamp

> **Note:** This is a demonstration system with synthetic patient data. It is not certified for production clinical use. Always consult applicable regulations (HIPAA, HITECH, state law) before deploying any EHR system with real patient data.

## Demo Data

The system initializes with two synthetic patients for testing:

- **Sarah Mitchell** (MRN: 2018-04792) — Type 2 diabetes, CKD Stage 3, hypertension
- **Robert Chen** (MRN: 2020-18834) — COPD, heart failure, atrial fibrillation

All contact information uses `555-555-XXXX` phone numbers and `example.com` email domains. No real patient data is included.
